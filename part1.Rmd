```{r, eval=T, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("car")
library(car)
library(GGally)
data(SLID, package = "carData")
SLID = SLID[complete.cases(SLID), ]
ggpairs(SLID)
```

Draw a matrix of diagnostic plots of all the variables and comment briefly on the relationship between some of the variables. 

Wage has a positive correlation with the numerical variables education and age as well as the qualitative variable sex. 


We want to study how the qualitative variable wages depends on one or more explanatory variables. Which
assumptions do we need make about the data if we want to perform a multiple linear regression analysis?

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
